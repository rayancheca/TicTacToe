# TicTacToe


This web application is a simple implementation of the classic game "Tic Tac Toe". The game can be played on any device that supports a modern web browser.

User Interface

The interface includes a 3x3 grid representing the Tic Tac Toe board, where users can click on each cell to place their mark ('X' or 'O').

How to Run

You can run the game by opening the HTML file in your browser.

Code Structure

This application uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

HTML
The HTML is divided into two main sections:

A heading section that contains a heading element for the title of the game.
A content section that contains a 3x3 grid of buttons which make up the Tic Tac Toe board.
Each cell in the Tic Tac Toe board is represented by a button element. The buttons are identified by ids 'btn0' through 'btn8'.

CSS
The CSS code in the HTML file is used to style the application. It defines styles for the container elements as well as the buttons in the Tic Tac Toe grid. The grid is implemented using the CSS Grid layout model.

JavaScript
The JavaScript code controls the game logic. It listens for click events on the buttons, updates the text of the button to 'X' or 'O' depending on the current turn, disables the button after it's been clicked, and checks if a player has won or if the game is a draw.

Audio is also incorporated in the game. Sounds play when a cell is clicked, when a player wins, or when the game is a draw.

Limitations

This code does not currently support playing against an AI. The game must be played by two players on the same device.

Future Development

In future iterations, features such as an AI opponent or the ability to play online against other players could be added. Also, additional customization options (such as the ability to choose player symbols or change the grid size) might be considered.
